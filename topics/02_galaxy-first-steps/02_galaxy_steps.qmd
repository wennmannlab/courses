## A short introduction to Galaxy

To get started with the Galaxy platform, complete the following tutorial. It takes about 40 minutes and will familiarize you with the interface and the most important Galaxy terms. You will also upload your first data.

## Create a new history

Now that the tutorial is complete, we can plan the work with our own data. To do this, we create a new, empty history. Then we rename the history to **Data NCBI**

## Rename the new history

After creating the new history, we rename it. With the new name, it can be clearly identified and cannot be confused with previous analyses.

## Upload from sequencing files

The sequence data that provided here is taken from one of my publications and is intended to serve as an example. The sequence data has been published on NCBI SRA and is freely available. The sequenced sample is a large dsDNA virus and the data is small in size. The small size makes it perfect, easy and quick to handle.
