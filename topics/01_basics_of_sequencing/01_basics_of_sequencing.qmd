## From DNA to PCR to Sequencing

To understand how DNA sequencing works, we first need to look at the basics of DNA replication. We also need to understand how DNA is extended and how science uses it for PCR. This is because PCR was the basis for the first method of DNA sequencing, known as Sanger sequencing.

## Next generation sequencing (NGS)

The most widely used sequencing method is Illumina sequencing, a high-throughput sequencing or massively parallel sequencing technique. It is one of the next generation sequencing techniques.

## Nanopore sequencing

One of the latest technologies for DNA sequencing is nanopore sequencing.
Here, single-stranded DNA is passed through a pore.
The resulting voltage changes are measured and converted into ATGC.
